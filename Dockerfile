# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml (context ., file Dockerfile) and pushed
# to Artifact Registry.
#
# A job image, not a server: the default command runs the test suite with
# CTest and exits 0 only when every test passes. It will never satisfy a $PORT
# health check. One stage on purpose: ctest needs CMake and the build tree at
# run time, so there is nothing to strip into a smaller runtime image.
# The library and its tests are compiled at build time (GoogleTest is fetched
# then, by CMake's FetchContent); running the image only runs them.
